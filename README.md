## Will I get banned?

No! This does not affect any Rocket league files. This is not a cheat or a hack. From rocket leagues point of view someone is just typing in game and chatting.

## How do I use with PS4, PS5, KBM?

I play with xbox controller so thats what this script is, HOWEVER if you want to use with other controllers all you need to do is run `button_value_tester.py` to figure out how your controller is mapped. Its pretty easy to figure out. 

Once you have all the buttons written down open rlQuickchat.py in notepad and ctrl+f to find the line that starts with `buttons = {` (line 1109 at the time of writing) and change the values to match. 

After mapping your controller in the script scroll down to line 1420 and start configuring the script for the responses and button combinations you want to use. 

This method works for all controllers and KBM but is not turn-key like xbox controller.
